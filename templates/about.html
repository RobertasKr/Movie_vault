    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Movie Vault</strong>, your one-stop destination for discovering, organizing, and reviewing movies!</p>

    <p>Our platform connects you to a vast database of films, using <strong>The Movie Database (TMDB) API</strong> to bring you detailed and up-to-date information on movies from around the world. Whether you're a casual moviegoer or a dedicated cinephile, we offer everything you need to explore and keep track of the films that matter to you.</p>

    <h3>What You Can Do:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search Movies:</strong> Instantly find any movie you're curious about. With TMDB’s extensive library, you can explore films from the latest blockbusters to timeless classics.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Your Watchlist:</strong> Easily add movies to your personal watchlist, so you never forget what you want to watch next.</li>
        <li><strong>Leave Reviews:</strong> Share your thoughts and opinions on the movies you’ve watched. Your reviews help others decide what to watch next.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This website was built as the <strong>final project for my CodeAcademy courses</strong>, where I applied the skills I’ve learned in web development and Python to create an interactive and dynamic platform for movie lovers.</p>

    <p>I’m excited to share this project with you and look forward to growing the community of film enthusiasts!</p>
